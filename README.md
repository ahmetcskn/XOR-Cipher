# XOR-Cipher
A simple Python implementation of XOR encryption with base64 encoding.

## Features

Text encryption using XOR cipher
Base64 encoding of encrypted text
Text decryption with error handling
Colorful command-line interface

## Requirements

Python 3.x

colorama

base64 (built-in)

## Installation
```bash
pip install colorama
```
## Usage
Run the script and follow the interactive menu:

1.Select option 1 to encrypt text

2.Select option 2 to decrypt text

3.Enter 'q' to quit

For each operation, you'll need to provide:

• Text to encrypt/decrypt

• Encryption key

## Example
```bash
python xor_cipher.py
```
## Security Note
This is a basic implementation for educational purposes. For serious encryption needs, use established cryptographic libraries.
